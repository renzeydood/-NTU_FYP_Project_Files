# FYP: Adapting Robot Exploration to Incorporate Intelligence

---

### To dos:
* Finish TCP communication between RPi and Remote PC
* Create communication protocol between ECG (Bluetooth) and Remote PC
* Tweak PID to encorporate turns while robot moving. Probably need to 'deattach' PID and make speed values global. Then angle of turn is determined on the speed ratio of the 2 wheels
* Add colour detection for RPi, (For traffic light control)
* Add a simple line follower for the robot to follow (Can reference from DuckieTown)
